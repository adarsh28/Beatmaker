Our Beatmaker is a metronome, It is a device that produces a steady pulse to help musicians play in time. The pulse is measured in BPM (beats-per-minute). A tempo marking of 60 BPM equals one beat per second, while 120 BPM equals two beats per second.

A metronome is commonly used as a practice tool to help maintain a steady tempo while learning difficult passages. It is also used in live performances and recording studios to ensure an accurate tempo throughout the performance or session.
